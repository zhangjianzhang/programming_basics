      "[C] The advice, issued Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics, may come as a shock to some parents. After spending years fretting（烦恼）over which toys to buy, which apps to download and which skill-building programs to send their kids to after school, letting them simply play—or better yet, playing with them—could seem like a step backward. The pediatricians insist that it’s not. The academy’s guidance does not include specific recommendations for the dosing of play. Instead, it asks doctors to advise parents before their babies turn two that play is essential to healthy development.\n",
      "\n",
      "[D] “Play is not silly behavior,” the academy’s report declares. It fosters children’s creativity, cooperation and problem-solving skills—all of which are critical for a 21st-century workforce. When parents engage in play with their children, it builds a wall against the harmful effects of all kinds of stress, including poverty, the academy says. In the pediatricians’ view, essentially every life skill that’s valued in adults can be built up with play. “Collaboration, negotiation, decision-making, creativity, leadership, and increased physical activity are just some of the skills and benefits children gain through play,” they wrote. The pediatricians’ appeal comes as kids are being squeezed by increasing academic demands at school and the constant invasion of digital media.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E] The trends have been a long time coming. Between 1981 and 1997, detailed time-use studies showed that the time children spent at play declined by 25 percent. Since the adoption of sweeping education reforms in 2001, public schools have steadily increased the amount of time devoted to preparing for standardized tests. The focus on academic “skills and drills” has cut deeply into recess（课间休息）and other time for free play.\n",
      "\n",
      "[F] By 2009, a study of Los Angeles kindergarten classrooms found that five-year-olds were so burdened with academic requirements that they were down to an average of just 19 minutes per day of “choice time,” when they were permitted to play freely with blocks, toys or other children. One in four Los Angeles teachers reported there was no time at all for “free play.” Increased academic pressures have left 30 percent of U.S. kindergarten classes without any recess. Such findings prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to issue a policy statement in 2013 on the “crucial role of recess in school.”\n",
      "\n",
      "[G] Pediatricians aren’t the only ones who have noticed. In a report titled “Crisis in the Kindergarten,” a group of educators, health professionals and child advocates called the loss of play in early childhood “a tragedy, both for the children themselves and for our nation and world.” Kids in play-based kindergartens “end up equally good or better at reading and other intellectual skills, and they are more likely to become well-adjusted healthy people,” the Alliance for Childhood said in 2009. Indeed, new research demonstrates why playing with blocks might have been time better spent, Yogman said. The trial assessed the effectiveness of an early mathematics intervention（干预）aimed at preschoolers. The results showed almost no gains in math achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "[H] Another playtime thief: the growing proportion of kids’ time spent in front of screens and digital devices, even among preschoolers. Last year, Common Sense Media reported that children up through age eight spent an average of two hours and 19 minutes in front of screens each day, including an average of 42 minutes a day for those under two. This increase of digital use comes with rising risks of obesity, sleep deprivation and cognitive（认知的）, language and social-emotional delays, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "[I] “I respect that parents have busy lives and it’s easy to hand a child an iPhone,” Yogman said. “But there’s a cost to that. For young children, it’s much too passive. And kids really learn better when they’re actively engaged and have to really discover things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "[J] The decline of play is a special hazard for the roughly 1 in 5 children in the United States who live in poverty. These 14 million children most urgently need to develop the resilience（韧劲）that is cultivated with play. Instead, Yogman said, they are disproportionately affected by some of the trends that are making play scarce: academic pressures at schools that need to improve test scores, outside play areas that are limited or unsafe, and parents who lack the time or energy to share in playtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "[K] Yogman also worries about the pressures that squeeze playtime for more affluent kids. “The notion that as parents we need to schedule every minute of their time is not doing them a great service,” he said. Even well-meaning parents may be “robbing them of the opportunity to have that joy of discovery and curiosity—the opportunity to find things out on their own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Play may not be a hard sell to kids. But UCLA pediatrician Carlos Lerner acknowledged that the pediatricians’ new prescription may meet with skepticism（怀疑） from parents, who are anxious for advice on how to give their kids a leg up in the world. They should welcome the simplicity of the message, Lerner said. “It’s liberating to be able to offer them this advice: that you spending time with your child and letting him play is one of the most valuable things you can do,” he said. “It doesn’t have to involve spending a lot of money or time, or joining a parenting group. It’s something we can offer that’s achievable. They just don’t recognize it right now as particularly valuable.”\n",

For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D) .You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passage One\n",
      "Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.\n",
      "Americans spend billions of dollars each year trying to change our weight with diets, gym memberships and plastic surgery.\n",
      "Trying to live up to the images of “perfect” models and movie heroes has a dark side: anxiety and depression, as well as unhealthy strategies for weight loss or muscle gain. It also has a financial cost. Having an eating disorder boosts annual health care costs by nearly US$2,000 per person.\n",
      "Why is there both external and internal pressure to look “perfect”? One reason is that society rewards people who are thin and healthy looking. Researchers have shown that body mass index is related to wages and income. Especially for women, there is a clear penalty at work for being overweight or obese. Some studies have also found an impact for men, though a less noticeable one.\n",
      "While the research literature is clear that labor market success is partly based on how employers and customers perceive your body image, no one had explored the other side of question. Does a person's own perception of body image matter to earnings and other indicators of success in the workplace?\n",
      "Our recently published study answered this question by tracking a large national random sample of Americans over a critical time period when bodies change from teenage shape into adult form and when people build their identities.\n",
      "As in other research, women in our sample tend to over-perceive their weight—they think they're heavier than they are—while men tend to under-perceive theirs.\n",
      "We found no relationship between the average person's self- perception of weight and labor market outcomes, although self-perceived weight can influence self-esteem（自尊心）, mental health and health behaviors.\n",
      "While the continued gender penalty in the labor market is frustrating, our finding that misperceived weight does not harm workers is more heartening.\n",
      "Since employers’ perception of weight is what matters in the labor market, changing discrimination laws to include body type as a category would also help. Michigan is the only state that prohibits discrimination on the basis of weight and height. We believe expanding such protections would make the labor market more fair and efficient.\n",

      "47. What have researchers found out about people’s earnings?\n",
      "A) They are closely related to people’s social status.\n",
      "B) They have to do with people’s body weight and shape.\n",

      "D) Gender inequality continues to frustrate a lot of female employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "50. What does the author think would help improve the condition in the labor market?\n",
      "A) Banning discrimination on the basis of employees’ body image.\n",

      "Passage Two\n",
      "Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work-life balance is dead. By this, I'm not advocating that you should give up your pursuit of having a fulfilling career and a thriving personal life, and I’m definitely not saying that you have to give up one to have the other. I also acknowledge that we have a work-life problem, but I'm arguing that the concept of balance has never been helpful, because it's too limiting. You see, our language makes a difference, and how we refer to things matters because it affects our thinking and therefore our actions.\n",
      "At the minimum, most of us work because we want to be able to support ourselves, our families, and the people around us. In the ideal world, we're all doing work that we're proud of and that provides meaning and purpose to us. But even if your job doesn't give you shivers of joy each new day, working is a part of what each of us does and the contribution we make to society. When you separate work and life, it’s a little bit harder to make that connection. But when you think of work as part of a full life and a complete experience, it becomes easier to see that success in one aspect often supports another.\n",
      "Losing your balance and falling isn’t pleasant. A goal to balance suggests that things could quickly get off the balance, and that causes terrible outcomes. It’s more constructive to think of solutions that continue to evolve over shifts in life and work. Rather than falling or failing, you may have good days or better days or not-so-good days. These variations are normal, and it’s more useful to think of life as something that is ever evolving and changing, rather than a high-risk enterprise where things could go wrong with one misstep.\n",
      "How we talk to ourselves matters, and how we talk about issues makes a difference. Let’s bury “work-life balance” and think bigger and better about work-life fulfillment to do a little less balancing and a lot more living.\n",
      "\n",
      "51. What does the author suggest by saying “The work-life balance is dead”?\n",
      "A) The hope of achieving a thriving life is impossible to realize.\n",
      "B) The pursuit of a fulfilling career involves personal sacrifice.\n",
      "C) The imbalance between work and life simply doesn’t exist anymore\n",
      "D) The concept of work-life balance contributes little to a fulfilling life.\n",
      "52. What does the author say about our use of language?\n",
      "A) It impacts how we think and behave.\n",
      "B) It changes with the passage of time.\n",
      "C) It reflects how we communicate.\n",
      "D) It differs from person to person.\n",
      "53. What does the author say we do in an ideal world?\n",
      "A) We do work that betters the lives of our families and friends.\n",
      "B) We do work that gives us bursts of joy each new day.\n",
      "C) We do meaningful work that contributes to society.\n",
      "D) We do demanding work that brings our capacity into full play.\n",
      "54. What does the author say about life?\n",
      "A) It is cyclical.\n",
      "B) It is dynamic.\n",
      "C) It is fulfilling.\n",
      "D) It is risky.\n",
      "What does the author advise us to do?\n",
      "A) Make life as simple as possible.\n",
      "B) Talk about balance in simpler terms.\n",

      "The use of PowerPoint is becoming increasingly popular in class, especially in the past few decades. From my personal perspective, the importance of the above-mentioned trend is beyond question.\n",
      "My reasons are listed below. For one thing, using PowerPoint instead of the traditional blackboard to illustrate the content of the lecture is a much more effective method for students to learn. Since now students can take the whole PowerPoint back after class, they can completely concentrate on the lecture instead of listening and taking notes at the same time. For another thing, using PowerPoint in class can also benefit the lecturer greatly. It has been long proved that the traditional way to use chalks to write on the blackboard has a negative effect on teachers’ lungs, and PowerPoint solves the issue.\n",
      "In a word, the importance of using PowerPoint in education should be recognized by all of us, and I sincerely hope that the rising popularity of this trend will lead to a more effective and healthier learning environment.\n",

      "Tea has a history of 5,000 years. There is a legend that when Shen Nong was about to drink boiling water, a few wild tree leaves fell into the kettle and the boiling water immediately gave off pleasant fragrance. He drank a little water, feeling very refreshed. Therefore, tea was found in this way. Since then, tea has begun to be popular in China. Tea gardens spread all over the country, and tea merchants became rich. Expensive and elegant tea sets have become a symbol of social status. Today, tea is not only a healthy drink, but also a part of Chinese culture. More and more international tourists learn about Chinese culture when they drink tea.\n",
